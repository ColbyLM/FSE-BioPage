            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a driven leader with a talent for customer service, time management, and complex problem solving. I’ve proven myself a team player who works hard and can adapt to any challenge with quality results. I’ve also worked diligently to hone my skills in coding automation, maintaining training, and analytical skills to make data driven decisions. I thrive on learning new skills and facing new challenges. I’m always looking for more ways to self-develop, exercise critical thinking and grow as an individual.
